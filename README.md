[00:34.40] I think this is a song of hope
[00:49.40] 
[00:52.79] There's a lady who's sure
[00:56.02] All that glitters is gold
[00:59.33] And she's buying a stairway to heaven
[01:06.08] And when she gets there, she knows
[01:09.35] If the stores are all closed
[01:12.24] With a word she can get what she came for
[01:32.74] 
[01:20.10] Ooh-o-oo, ooh-oo-oo-ooh
[01:25.49] And she's buying a stairway to heaven
[01:43.99] 
[01:32.72] There's a sign on the wall
[01:35.88] But she wants to be sure
[01:39.25] 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
[01:46.12] In a tree by the brook
[01:49.61] There's a songbird who sings
[01:52.52] Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven, and I think you can see that
[02:28.52] 
[02:17.89] And it makes me wonder, she does
[02:27.07] Oh-oh-o-oh, yes sir
[02:36.57] 
[02:38.05] There's a feeling I get
[02:40.94] When I look to the west
[02:43.71] And my spirit is crying for leaving
[02:49.65] In my thoughts I have seen
[02:53.30] Rings of smoke through the trees
[02:56.58] And the voices of those who stand looking
[03:17.08] 
[03:08.86] Aha-aha, aha-aha, ooh, woah, woah, woah, woah
[03:31.36] 
[03:28.78] And it's whispered that soon
[03:31.84] If we all call the tune
[03:34.78] Then the piper will lead us to reason
[03:40.82] And a new day will dawn
[03:43.55] For those who stand long
[03:46.56] And the forests will echo with laughter, does anybody remember laughter?
[04:22.56] 
[04:11.81] Baby, oh!
[04:18.35] Just give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
[04:23.85] She does, she does
[04:25.93] But I got some good news, listen
[04:41.93] 
[04:26.38] If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
[04:27.34] Don't be alarmed now
[04:28.59] It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
[04:30.52] Yes, there are two paths you can go by
[04:34.24] But in the long run
[04:36.68] There's still time to change the road you're on, I hope so
[05:05.68] 
[04:47.85] Aah, baby, baby, baby
[05:01.74] Wait a minute
[05:08.24] 
[05:06.13] Your head is humming and it won't go
[05:10.18] In case you don't know
[05:12.35] The piper's calling you to join him
[05:18.05] Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
[05:21.87] And did you know
[05:24.22] Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, ooh, oh, oh
[05:51.22] 
[06:44.01] And as we wind on down the road
[06:48.61] Our shadows taller than our souls
[06:53.24] There walks a lady we all know
[06:58.06] Who shines white light and wants to show
[07:02.32] How everything still turns to gold, yeah
[07:07.12] And if you listen very hard
[07:11.33] The tune will come to you at last
[07:16.01] When all is one and one is all
[07:21.27] To be a rock and not to roll, not to roll
[07:41.77] 
[07:46.32] And she's buying a stairway to heaven
